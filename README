General

-  The Alliance starting experience for worgen is available. Venture
   through the cursed lands of Gilneas to discover your true path!
   Currently the female worgen character is not available for testing.
-  The Horde starting experience for goblins is available. Beginning on
   the Isle of Kezan in a goblin paradise, players will face a
   treacherous road ahead!
-  The level cap for all characters is 82.
-  Players may use our Character Copy feature for copying existing
   characters to beta realms, or may choose from high-level pre-made
   template characters.

Zones

-  Mount Hyjal and Vashj'ir, two new level 78-82 zones, are available
   for testing. Players may find their way to these zones by speaking
   with temporary teleportation NPCs located in any major city.
-  The level ranges of Gilneas and the Lost Isles are in the process of
   being adjusted slightly. Creature, quest, and quest reward levels
   are all being altered so that players finish questing in these zones
   roughly by level 12. Further fine tuning will continue in future
   patches.
-  Several zones have had quest maps integrated.
-  *Updated* - Eastern Kingdoms
   Arathi Highlands, Blasted Lands, Dun Morogh, Elwynn Forest, Loch
   Modan, Northshire, Westfall, Hinterlands and Redridge Mountains are
   ready for testing.
   Stranglethorn Vale (currently Horde only) is available for testing.
-  Kalimdor
   Most zones in Kalimdor are available for testing, though work
   continues on polishing the quest experience and flow, as well as
   zone aesthetics.

Dungeons & Raids

-  Teleportation NPCs in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, and Dalaran can
   transport players to any available new dungeons, including players
   who are ghosts.
-  Blackrock Caverns, a new level 79-81 five-player dungeon, is
   available for testing.
-  *New* - Throne of the Tides, a new level 79-81 five-player dungeon,
   is partially available for testing.

Classes

-  Hunters should now start with a pet at level 1.

User Interface

-  The ability to use third-party addons has been temporarily disabled
   for the test environment.

*New* - Graphics

-  Experimental support for DX11 (can be enabled by passing ‘-d3d11’ on
   the command line or adding SET gxApi "d3d11" to the Config.WTF file).
-  OpenGL Hardware Cursor support (can be enabled on the Video
   Resolution Panel).
-  Improved water and lava rendering system (enabled by the Liquid
   Detail slider on the Video Effects Panel)
   0 = Classic Water
   1 = New Water (fake reflections)
   2 = New Water (ocean has real reflection for terrain)
   These values are likely to change during Beta.
-  Dynamic Sunshafts effect (enabled by the Sunshafts option on the
   Video Effects Panel).

Bug Fixes

-  Fixed a bug with goblins and worgen that was causing certain NPCs to
   appear neutral to these races.
