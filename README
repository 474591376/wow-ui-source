General

-  The Alliance starting experience for worgen is available. Venture
   through the cursed lands of Gilneas to discover your true path!
   Currently the female worgen character is not available for testing.
-  The Horde starting experience for goblins is available. Beginning on
   the Isle of Kezan in a goblin paradise, players will face a
   treacherous road ahead!
-  The level cap for all characters is 83.
-  Players may use our Character Copy feature for copying existing
   characters to beta realms, or may choose from high-level pre-made
   template characters.

Zones

-  Mount Hyjal and Vashj'ir, two new level 78-82 zones, are available
   for testing. Deepholm, a new level 82-83 zone is available for
   testing. Players may find their way to these zones by speaking with
   temporary teleportation NPCs located in any major city.
-  The level ranges of Gilneas and the Lost Isles are in the process of
   being adjusted slightly. Creature, quest, and quest reward levels
   are all being altered so that players finish questing in these zones
   roughly by level 12. Further fine tuning will continue in future
   content updates.
-  Several zones have had quest maps integrated.
-  Eastern Kingdoms
   Arathi Highlands, Blasted Lands, The Cape of Stranglethorn, Dun
   Morogh, Duskwood, Elwynn Forest, Hinterlands, Loch Modan, Northern
   Stranglethorn, Northshire, Redridge Mountains, Tirisfal Glades,
   Western Plaguelands and Westfall are available for testing.
-  Kalimdor
-  Most zones in Kalimdor are available for testing, though work
   continues on polishing the quest experience and flow, as well as
   zone aesthetics.

Dungeons & Raids

-  Teleportation NPCs in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, and Dalaran can
   transport players to any available new dungeons, including players
   who are ghosts.
-  Blackrock Caverns, a new level 79-81 five-player dungeon, is
   available for testing.
-  Throne of the Tides, a new level 79-81 five-player dungeon, is
   partially available for testing.

Classes: General

-  Ammo has been removed from the game.
-  The character levels at which classes gain new spells and abilities
   have changed.
-  The glyph system is in the process of being altered. Existing glyphs
   may not be fully supported or functional.
-  Many item and class stats have been changed or removed.
-  Rage has been normalized.
-  Spells and abilities no longer have multiple ranks and now scale
   with character level.
-  A first pass on new talent trees has been implemented.
   o	Each specialization has been reduced to a 31-point talent tree.
   Players will now get a total of 41 talent points to spend.
   31 points must be spent in the primary specialization tree before
   any points can be placed in additional trees.
   Players will be asked to choose a specialization at level 10. Doing
   so will result in the unlocking of a spell or ability unique to that
   specialization, as well as one or more passive bonuses.
   While this is a first pass on all of the talent trees, death knight,
   druid, paladin, warlock, Arcane mage, and Assassination rogue trees
   are not as far along as other specializations.
   More information regarding our plans for talent trees can be found
   on our Cataclysm forum:

Death Knights

-  A dedicated tanking tree has been implemented.
-  The way in which runes recharge has changed.

Druids

-  A new Eclipse mechanic has been added for druids. The feature is
   functional, but the interface art is still a work in-progress.

Hunters

-  Five pets can now be stored with the hunter at all times. Any one of
   these five pets can be summoned via the Call Pet ability.
-  Focus has replaced mana as a new resource.
-  Hunters now start with a pet at level 1.
-  The Stable will now store 20 pets. If a pet is moved into the
   Stable, its talents are wiped.

Paladins

-  We are in the process of overhauling many paladin talents, spells
   and abilities. Expect updates in upcoming patches.

Warlocks

-  Soul Shards have been removed from the game as items. Instead, they
   now exist as a resource system necessary for using, or altering the
   mechanics of certain spells.

User Interface

-  The ability to use third-party addons has been temporarily disabled
   for the test environment.
-  The Arena Teams pane has been improved.
-  Auto-quests have been added to the game. Players will automatically
   be given an auto-quest by entering specific areas in the game world.
   This alert will appear distinctly in the Objectives pane via the
   Advanced Quest Tracking feature. These quests will still be given to
   players with full Quest Logs, but will count toward the 25 total]
   allotted quests if the log is not full.
-  The Character pane has been redesigned. Character stats can now be
   shown or hidden via the Show All Details/Hide All Details button on
   the bottom left. When shown, all character stats will be visible in
   a window to the right of the pane. Stat sections can be reorganized
   by clicking and dragging them up or down the pane.
-  The Professions panes now have more filtering and search
   functionality, as well as buttons to easily link recipes in the chat
   frame.
-  A Professions screen has been added to the Spellbook to better
   display the details of a character’s primary and secondary
   professions.
-  Many of the yellow System Messages that would display in the chat
   frame when leveling up have been removed.
-  New text animations now alert players as they level up, also
   providing information on when new talents, spells and abilities are
   available.
-  Professions and Class Trainers windows have been altered to more
   clearly display available and upcoming purchases.
-  The Spellbook interface has been improved for greater ease-of-use
   and visual appeal.

Graphics

-  Experimental support for DX11 (can be enabled by passing ‘-d3d11’ on
   the command line or adding SET gxApi "d3d11" to the Config.WTF file).
-  OpenGL Hardware Cursor support (can be enabled on the Video
   Resolution Panel).
-  Improved water and lava rendering system (enabled by the Liquid
   Detail slider on the Video Effects Panel)
   0 = Classic Water
   1 = New Water (fake reflections)
   2 = New Water (ocean has real reflection for terrain)
   These values are likely to change during Beta.
-  Dynamic Sunshafts effect (enabled by the Sunshafts option on the
   Video Effects Panel).

Known Issues

-  Selecting high Liquid Detail when using Geforce 6 & 7 series video
   cards will currently prevent lava and water from rendering properly.
   You can temporarily restore liquid to the world by reducing the
   Liquid Detail setting via the Video Effects Panel, or by typing
   “waterDetail 0” in your Config.WTF file.
