World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Beta Patch 1

General

-  Arathi Highlands, Blasted Lands, Dun Morogh, Elwynn Forest, Loch
   Modan, Northshire, and Westfall are ready for testing.
-  Several zones have had quest maps integrated.
-  The level ranges of Gilneas and the Lost Isles are in the process of
   being adjusted slightly. Creature, quest, and quest reward levels
   are all being altered so that players finish questing in these zones
   roughly by level 12. Further fine tuning will continue in future
   patches.

Dungeons

-  Blackrock Caverns: Teleportation NPCs in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, and
   Dalaran can now transport players to this dungeon, including players
   who are ghosts.

Classes

-  Hunters should now start with a pet at level 1.

User Interface

-  The ability to use third-party addons has been temporarily disabled
   for the test environment.

Bug Fixes

-  Fixed a bug with goblins and worgen that was causing certain NPCs to
   appear neutral to these races.
