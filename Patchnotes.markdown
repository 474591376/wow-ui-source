**General**

  * All existing Valor Points in the Currency tab have been converted to
Justice Points.

  * The Keyring bag slot has been removed to make room in the user interface
for new features.

    * Keys which no longer serve a purpose in the game will be removed from
player inventories. Compensation for the keys will be automatically provided
in the form of each key's vendor sell price in gold.

    * Keys which are obsolete quest items will be removed from player
inventories.

    * Keys which may still be of use to players will be transferred to regular
inventory space. If a player's bags are full, these keys will sit in a
backlogged inventory until sufficient space is made available. Once space is
opened, the keys will appear in regular inventory upon the player logging out
or switching zones.

**[Achievements][32]**

  * Bear-ly Made It (new achievement): Save all four prisoners before they are
sacrificed in Zul'Aman on Heroic difficulty.

**[Classes: General][33]**

  * All healing critical strikes now heal for 2 times a normal heal (+100%),
up from 1.5 times a normal heal (+50%).

  * Dodge: Death Knights, paladins, and warriors no longer receive any bonus
to their chance to dodge from Agility. Their base chance to dodge is now a
fixed 5%.

  * Parry: Death Knights, paladins, and warriors now receive 27% of their
Strength bonuses as parry rating, up from 25%. This conversion still only
applies to Strength above and beyond their base Strength.

  * Players are once again free to dance in combat (without causing graphic
errors). Other animations, such as attacks, will take precedence over dancing.
The dance animation will be suppressed until the higher priority animation is
complete. Fun has been unnerfed.

  * Buffs

    * All class abilities which place a buff on friendly targets no longer
generate any threat. This goes for raid-wide buffs like Mark of the Wild and
Power Word: Fortitude, as well as triggered effects such as Blessed Resilience
or Fingers of Frost, and single-target buffs like Dark Intent and Hysteria.
The exception is buffs which directly cause healing or damage, such as Thorns
or Renew. Abilities such as these still generate normal threat.

  * Crowd Control

    * Many crowd control abilities no longer cause creatures to attack players
when they are cast. The creature will not attack the player when the crowd
control wears off, and nearby creatures will not become hostile to the player
either. However, if a visible player gets too close to the target creature,
the creature will remember and attack the player when the crowd control effect
wears off. The intent is to make it easier for dungeon groups to manage crowd
control assignments and pulling packs of hostile NPCs. The abilities affected
by this change are: Hibernate, Entangling Roots, Wyvern Sting (will still
cause hostility when it begins to deal damage), Freezing Trap, Polymorph,
Repentance, Shackle Undead, Blind, Hex, Bind Elemental, Banish, Seduction.

  * Pets

    * The Aggressive pet stance has been removed and replaced with the Assist
stance. This stance will cause the player's pet to attack the player's target.
The pet will not change targets unless the master attacks a new target for a
few seconds.

  * Spell Interrupts

    * When interrupted while casting a single-school spell such as Mind Flay
or Frostbolt, players will now be able to cast dual-school spells such as Mind
Spike (Frost and Shadow schools) or Frostfire Bolt (Frost and Fire schools).
However, being interrupted while casting a dual-school spell will still
interrupt all respective schools as intended.

**[![][5]][34] [Death Knights][34]**

  * Obliterate base damage has been reduced to 150% weapon damage, down from
160%.

  * Talent Specializations

    * Frost

      * Annihilation now increases Obliterate damage by 12/24/36%, down from
15/30/45%.

    * Unholy

      * Unholy Might now increases Strength by 10%, up from 5%.

**[![][7]][35] [Druids][35]**

  * Druids now gain 1 attack power per point of Strength, down from 2. They
continue to gain 2 attack power per point of Agility while in Cat Form or Bear
Form.

  * Entangling Roots and the equivalent spell triggered by Nature's Grasp no
longer deal damage.

  * Ferocious Bite damage has been increased by 15%. In addition, its base
cost has been reduced to 25 energy and it can use up to 25 energy, for up to a
100% damage increase.

  * Innervate now grants an ally target 5% of his or her maximum mana over 10
seconds, but still grants 20% of the druid's maximum mana over 10 seconds when
self-cast.

  * Mangle (Cat) damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 530%
weapon damage, up from 460%.

  * Omen of Clarity clearcasting buff from now lasts 15 seconds, up from 8
seconds.

  * Ravage damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 975% weapon
damage, up from 850%.

  * Shred damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 520% weapon
damage, up from 450%.

  * Swipe (Cat) now deals 600% weapon damage at level 80 or higher, down from
670%.

  * Talent Specializations

    * Balance

      * Earth and Moon's duration has been increased to 15 seconds, up from
12.

      * Fungal Growth spell visual effect has been updated to be less visually
intrusive and more aesthetic.

      * Lunar Shower has been redesigned. When casting Moonfire, the druid
gains Lunar Shower. Lunar Shower increases the direct damage done by Moonfire
by 15/30/45%, and reduces the mana cost by 10/20/30%. This effect stacks up to
3 times and lasts 3 seconds. While under the effects of Lunar Shower, Moonfire
generates 8 Solar Energy, and Sunfire generates 8 Lunar Energy. The amount of
Lunar/Solar Energy gained does not change based on the number of points spent
in the talent, or stacks of Lunar Shower. Those druids who wish to delay
transition in or out of an Eclipse state should now cast the one of their two
basic attacks which will not move the Eclipse bar (either Starfire or Wrath).

      * Solar Beam has a new spell effect.

      * Wild Mushroom: Detonate can now also trigger Earth and Moon, in
addition to Starfire and Wrath.

    * Restoration

      * Symbiosis (Mastery) has been removed and replaced with Harmony.
Harmony increases direct healing by an additional 10%, and casting direct
healing spells grants an additional 10% bonus to periodic healing for 10
seconds. Each point of mastery increases each bonus by an additional 1.25%.
Healing Touch, Nourish, Swiftmend, and the initial heal from Regrowth are
considered direct healing spells for the purposes of this Mastery. All other
healing from druid spells is considered periodic.

  * Glyphs

    * Glyph of Berserk duration increase is now 10 seconds, up from 5.

    * Glyph of Ferocious Bite has been redesigned. It now causes Ferocious
Bite to heal the caster for 1% of maximum health for each 10 energy used.

    * Glyph of Innervate now causes the druid to gain 10% of his or her
maximum mana over 10 seconds when Innervate is used on a friendly target, in
addition to Innervate's base effect.

**[![][9]][36] [Hunters][36]**

  * Multi-shot damage has been reduced. It now deals 120% weapon damage at
level 80 or higher, down from 137%.

  * Traps now scale with hunter stats such as hit, expertise, spell
penetration and attack power as intended.

  * Pets

    * Intervene (Pet Tenacity) has been redesigned. The pet runs at high speed
toward a group member, reducing the damage done by the next melee or ranged
attack made against them equal to 50% of the pet's total health.

**[![][11]][37] [Mages][37]**

  * Pyroblast: The version of this spell cast when Hot Streak is not active
did slightly less damage than the Hot Streak version. Its damage has been
increased so that both versions of Pyroblast now do the same amount of damage.

  * Spellsteal mana cost has been increased 100%

  * Talent Specializations

    * Fire

      * Impact: When Living Bomb is spread via this talent, it will only be
spread to two additional targets. The net effect is that if the Mage’s most
recent Living Bomb target is the same as their Impact target, that target will
no longer lose the Living Bomb effect. If Living Bomb is active on multiple
targets when the Impact effect is cast, Living Bomb will remain active on the
most recent Living Bomb target, and will be added to two other nearby targets.

    * Frost

      * Deep Freeze and Ring of Frost will now cause diminishing returns for
each other.

**[![][13]][38] [Paladins][38]**

  * Divine Light mana cost has been increased to 35% of base mana, up from
30%.

  * Flash of Light mana cost has been increased to 31% of base mana, up from
27%.

  * Holy Light mana cost has been increased to 12% of base mana, up from 10%.

  * Rebuke, Divine Shield and Divine Protection have new icons.

  * Seal of Righteousness – now can be proc’d by any melee ability, not just
single target melee abilities. This adds Hammer of the Righteous (the physical
component) and Divine Storm to the list of abilities that can proc it. In
addition, Seal of Righteousness procs can now crit.

  * Talent Specializations

    * Holy

      * Beacon of Light can no longer be dispelled. In addition, it now
transfers 100% of the heal from Holy Light, but still 50% of the heal from
other spells.

      * Denounce has been redesigned. It still reduces the mana cost of
Exorcism. However, it no longer has a chance on Holy Shock of making Exorcism
free and instant. Instead, it has a 50/100% chance to prevent the Exorcism
target from causing critical effects for the next 6 seconds. This effect can
be dispelled.

      * Holy Shock mana cost has been decreased to 7% of base mana, down from
8%.

      * Infusion of Light can now lower the cast time of Flash of Light by
0.75/1.5 seconds, in addition to Holy Light and Divine Light. In addition, the
old Denounce spell overlay effect has been transferred to Infusion of Light
since Denounce is no longer a proc.

      * Speed of Light now increases movement speed when Holy Radiance or
Divine Protection are cast. In addition, this talent now reduces the cooldown
of Holy Radiance by 13/26/40 seconds, up from 10/20/30.

      * Walk in the Light now improves Word of Glory healing by 30% in
addition to its current effects.

    * Protection

      * Ardent Defender has a new spell effect.

      * Guardian of Ancient Kings now uses the ‘Assist’ pet stance
functionality.

      * Hammer of the Righteous mana cost has been lowered to 10%, down from
12% to match Crusader Strike.

      * Judgements of the Wise now procs on attempt rather than on strike,
which means judgements that miss can still grant mana. This is to help ensure
Protection paladins are not starved for mana if they aren't capped on hit
rating.

    * Retribution

      * Seals of Command: This talent now makes Seal of Righteousness hit an
unlimited number of melee targets, instead of only 2 additional targets.

      * Selfless Healer can no longer be dispelled and cannot be stolen via
Spellsteal; and, in addition to its current effects, it lowers the cooldown of
Word of Glory by 5/10 seconds.

    * Glyphs

      * Glyph of Truth: The expertise bonus granted by this glyph now also
works when Seal of Righteousness is active.

**[![][15]][39] [Priests][39]**

  * Stealth now once again begins its cooldown once the rogue leaves Stealth.

**[![][19]][41] [Shaman][41]**

  * Lightning Shield and Water Shield can no longer be dispelled.

  * Unleash Elements is now in the Nature school, and thus can no longer be
used if a shaman's Nature school has been locked out.

  * Water Shield has had its internal cooldown reduced to 3.5 seconds, once
again matching other shields. The amount of mana restored when Water Shield
procs has been reduced by 50%.

  * Talent Specializations

    * Elemental

      * Lava Flows now grants a 30/60/90% haste buff when a Flame Shock effect
is dispelled, up from 10/20/30%.

      * Thunderstorm now reduces the movement speed of players it knocks back
by 40% for 5 seconds.

    * Restoration

      * Improved Water Shield has been redesigned and renamed Resurgence. When
Water Shield is active, Resurgence causes critical direct heals to restore
mana (Resurgence rank 2 is roughly equal to 150% of the old Improved Water
Shield value when a Healing Wave or Greater Healing Wave critically hits, and
scaled down accordingly for faster or multi-target spells).

      * Mana Tide now grants 200% of the caster's Spirit, down from 400%.

    * Eye of the Storm has been added into the rotation as a 10-man Rated
Battleground. The tug-of-war style capture points have been replaced with
Arathi Basin style capture points to better support 10v10 competition. This
change applies only to Rated Battlegrounds. Eye of the Storm is otherwise
still a 15-player Battleground with tug-of-war style capture points.

    * War Games

      * Many improvements are being made to the War Games interface, though
the changes are not yet fully functional.

  * Conquest Points

    * The minimum cap on Conquest Points earned per week is now 1500 at 1500
or less Battleground rating. The maximum cap remains 3000 at 3000 or more
Battleground rating. The cap continues to scale non-linearly between those two
points.

    * The game now separately tracks different Conquest Point caps for
Battlegrounds and Arenas. The cap for Arena rating will always be 2/3 of the
cap for Battleground rating at any given Arena rating. Players may earn a
total number of Conquest Points per week equal to the higher of these two
caps, but once players have reached the cap for either Arenas or
Battlegrounds, they can no longer earn Conquest Points from that source.
Conquest Points from Battleground holidays only count toward the total
Conquest Point cap.

**[Quests & Creatures][50]**

  * There are no longer oddities in the critical strike and dodge chance of
lower-level creatures.

**[User Interface][51]**

  * Characters can now be reorganized at the Character Selection screen. This
feature not yet fully functional and the reorganization of characters doesn't
save at this time.

  * The cast bar can now be moved to display below the Character frame.

  * Move Pad is a mouse-click interface for movement which is now built into
the base interface.

  * Raid Profiles are in the process of being implemented and are not fully
functional. Raid Profiles will allow players to save the raid window user
interface layout based on type of content (i.e. 10-player raids, 25-player
raids, Battlegrounds, etc.).
