**World of Warcraft PTR Patch 4.1**

The latest retail patch notes can be found [here][1].

**Important**: _These patch notes are not final. Additional updates will be
made, and all existing changes are subject to revision during the course of
the testing process. More information regarding patch 4.1 can be found
[here][2]. Visit our Public Test Realm forum for more information about the
testing process._

**General**

  * Flying mounts can now be used in Ghostlands.

  * Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to
increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40
resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to
10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A
player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their
damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain
slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as
their resilience climbs.

  * A dead player can now be resurrected by targeting them using the Party or
Raid Frame even if they have released. No more hunting for corpses.

**[Classes: General][3]**

  * All non-damaging interrupts off the global cooldown will now always hit
the target. This includes Pummel, Shield Bash, Kick, Mind Freeze, Rebuke,
Skull Bash, Counterspell, Wind Shear, Solar Beam, Silencing Shot, and related
player pet abilities.

**[Death Knights][4]**

  * Dark Simulacrum now works on numerous additional spells in dungeon
encounters.

  * Raise Ally has been redesigned to be a battle resurrection, analogous to
Rebirth. It is instant cast, but costs 50 Runic Power to use, and has a
10-minute cooldown. It shares the same global battle resurrection cap with
Rebirth and Soulstone.

  * Talent Specializations

    * Blood

      * Blood Shield now only works while in Blood Presence.

      * Death Strike self-healing no longer generates threat.

    * Frost

      * Blood of the North (passive) now permanently converts both Blood Runes
into Death Runes. There is no longer any proc interaction with Blood Strike
required to activate Death Runes.

      * Frost Strike now deals 130% of weapon damage, up from 110%.

      * Howling Blast damage has been increased by 20%. To compensate, the
area-of-effect splash now does 50% of the single-target damage, down from 60%.
The net result of this change leaves the area-of-effect damage roughly the
same as 4.0.6 numbers. In addition, Howling Blast now has a facing
requirement.

cast 60% faster.

affected targets when used.

    * Restoration

      * Gift of Nature (passive) also reduces Tranquility's cooldown by 2.5/5
minutes.

      * Efflorescence has been redesigned. It creates a healing zone at the
feet of a Swiftmend target, but this healing zone now restores health equal to
4/8/12% of the amount healed by Swiftmend to the three most injured targets
within 8 yards, every 1 second for 7 seconds. This periodic effect now also
benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical
effects.

      * Malfurion's Gift now reduces the cooldown of Tranquility by 2.5/5
minutes.

  * Glyphs

    * Glyph of Rake is now Glyph of Pounce, which increases the range of

the size of the pet slightly.
