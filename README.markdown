**World of Warcraft PTR Patch 4.1**

The latest retail patch notes can be found [here][1].

**Important**: _These patch notes are not final. Additional updates will be
made, and all existing changes are subject to revision during the course of
the testing process. More information regarding patch 4.1 can be found
[here][2]. Visit our Public Test Realm forum for more information about the
testing process._

**General**

  * Flying mounts can now be used in Ghostlands.

  * Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to
increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40
resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to
10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A
player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their
damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain
slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as
their resilience climbs.

**[Classes: General][3]**

  * All non-damaging interrupts off the global cooldown will now always hit
the target. This includes Pummel, Shield Bash, Kick, Mind Freeze, Rebuke,
Skull Bash, Counterspell, Wind Shear, Solar Beam, Silencing Shot, and related
player pet abilities.

**[Death Knights][4]**

  * Dark Simulacrum now works on numerous additional spells in dungeon
encounters.

  * Raise Ally has been redesigned to be a battle resurrection, analogous to
Rebirth. It is instant cast, but costs 50 Runic Power to use, and has a
10-minute cooldown. It shares the same global battle resurrection cap with
Rebirth and Soulstone.

  * Talent Specializations

    * Blood

      * Blood Shield now only works while in Blood Presence.

      * Death Strike self-healing no longer generates threat.

    * Frost

      * Blood of the North (passive) now permanently converts both Blood Runes
into Death Runes. There is no longer any proc interaction with Blood Strike
required to activate Death Runes.

      * Frost Strike now deals 130% of weapon damage, up from 110%.

      * Howling Blast damage has been increased by 20%. To compensate, the
area-of-effect splash now does 50% of the single-target damage, down from 60%.
The net result of this change leaves the area-of-effect damage roughly the
same as 4.0.6 numbers.

  * Glyphs

    * Glyph of Raise Ally is now Glyph of Death Gate, and makes Death Gate
cast 60% faster.

of Recuperate, down from 1%/2%.

**[Shaman][11]**

  * Fire Nova has been redesigned and decoupled from shaman Fire totems.
Instead, it now pulses the Fire Nova effect from each target that is afflicted
by the shaman's own Flame Shock debuff. It now damages all enemies except the

      * Improved Fire Nova has been redesigned and replaced by a talent called
Seasoned Winds. When an enemy spell cast is successfully prevented with Wind
Shear or Grounding Totem, the shaman gains magical resistance (in an amount

to the spell school(s) of the interrupted spell (except for Holy spells),
lasting 10 seconds.

to be the best guardian for single-target damage, and the Infernal the best
when there are multiple targets.

0.5/1 seconds in addition to its current effects.

      * Improved Slam increases Slam damage by 20/40%, up from 10/20%.

      * Juggernaut no longer adds 2 seconds to the Charge stun, but instead
lowers the cooldown of Charge by 2 seconds (to 13 seconds total without the
glyph).

      * Lambs to the Slaughter now causes Mortal Strike to refresh Rend in
addition to its current effects.

This change offsets the Flurry boost to better control Fury burst damage.

    * Protection

however, it now allows Shield Block to proc a second aura that reduces magic
damage by 7/14/20% for 6 seconds.

by default, instead of waiting for the key to go up. This is an option that

changed and operates on mouse click up.
