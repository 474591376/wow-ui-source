**General**

  * Cataclysm Launcher Update

    * The new Cataclysm Launcher allows you to stream game data while you
play. This will reduce the time you spend downloading, installing, and
patching World of Warcraft. We'd like to get your feedback on the toolset and
gameplay experience. Please head to the forums [here][3] for additional
information.

  * Reforging

    * Players can now visit special Reforging NPCs in capital cities located
near Enchanting trainers. 40% of any one secondary stat on an item can be can
be allocated to add a new secondary stat to the item. The stat being added
cannot already exist on the item. An item cannot have more than one reforged
stat at a time, though the Reforging of an item can be undone and changed.

  * Copied Test Realm characters are not copied with their achievement history
in order to better facilitate the character copy process.

**Classes: General**

  * Many class talents, spells, and abilities have been overhauled, added, or
removed.

  * All spell and ability tooltips will now display damage averages rather
than minimum and maximum damage potential. This feature is on by default but
can be changed via the Display settings under User Interface options.

  * Ammo has been removed from the game.

  * The character levels at which classes gain new spells and abilities have
changed.

  * Many item and class stats have been changed or removed.

  * Mastery rating has been added as a new stat which provides unique benefits
for characters based on class and talent specialization. Mastery rating does
not currently exist on items in the game, however, Reforging can be used to
add Mastery rating as a secondary stat to existing items.

  * Rage has been normalized.

  * Spells and abilities no longer have multiple ranks and now scale with
character level.

  * Talent trees have been altered. All player talent specializations have
been reset, allowing for free re-specialization.

    * Each specialization has been reduced to a 31-point talent tree.

    * Players will now get a total of 41 talent points to spend.

    * Players will be asked to choose a specialization at level 10. Doing so
will result in the unlocking of a spell or ability unique to that
specialization, as well as one or more passive bonuses.

    * Once a talent specialization has been chosen, players may only place
points in the primary tree until at least 31 points have been spent there.

    * The initial announcement regarding these talent tree changes can be
found on our [Cataclysm forum][4].

**Death Knights**

  * A dedicated tanking tree (Blood) has been implemented.

  * The effects of Blood Presence and Frost Presence have been exchanged.

  * The way in which runes recharge has changed.

**Druids**

  * A new Eclipse mechanic has been added for druids.

**Hunters**

  * Five pets can now be stored with the hunter at all times. Any one of these
five pets can be summoned via the Call Pet ability.

  * Focus has replaced mana as a new resource.

  * Hunters now start with a pet at level 1.

  * The Stable will now store 20 pets. If a pet is moved into the Stable, its
talents are wiped.

**Mages**

  * There is now a new spell fly-out UI feature for mage portals. Clicking on
the Teleport or Portal buttons will expand the list of choices available.

**Paladins**

  * Paladins now have a new resource bar.

**Warlocks**

  * There is now a new spell fly-out UI feature for warlock pets. Clicking on
this single button will open up the list of available pets to summon.

  * Soul Shards have been removed from the game as items. Instead, they now
exist as a resource system necessary for using, or altering the mechanics of
certain spells.

**Items**

  * Resilience no longer reduces the chance a player will be critically hit by
an opponent.

  * Durability: cloth, leather, and mail now have as many points of durability
as plate, making the repair cost on death much closer to equal for all
classes.

**Professions**

  * The glyph system has been updated to now feature three different types of
glyphs. Many class glyphs have been added, altered, or moved to different
glyph types.

**User Interface**

  * Spell Alerts have been added to notify players when procs on select spells
and abilities occur. A visual notification will display around the character
and the activated ability will be highlighted on the action bar.

  * The Arena Teams pane has been improved.

  * The Character pane has been redesigned. Character stats can now be shown
or hidden via the Show All Details/Hide All Details button on the bottom left.
When shown, all character stats will be visible in a window to the right of
the pane. Stat sections can be reorganized by clicking and dragging them up or
down the pane.

  * The Professions panes now have more filtering and search functionality, as
well as buttons to easily link recipes in the chat frame.

  * A Professions screen has been added to the Spellbook to better display the
details of a character's primary and secondary professions.

  * Many of the yellow System Messages that would display in the chat frame
when leveling up have been removed.

  * New text animations now alert players as they level up, also providing
information on when new talents, spells and abilities are available.

  * Professions and Class Trainers windows have been altered to more clearly
display available and upcoming purchases.

  * New Raid frames are now. They can also be used in place of the standard
5-player party interface via the User Interface options.

  * The Spellbook interface has been improved for greater ease-of-use and
visual appeal.

  * For additional notes on Lua and XML changes please visit the [UI & Macros
forum.][5]
