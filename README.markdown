**_General_**

  * Many tooltips have been updated to reflect any changes made via recent
[hotfixes][2].

  * Many rare creatures that went into hiding upon Deathwing's emergence into
Azeroth have made a return! In addition to finding new homes in a post-
Cataclysm world, they drop new, improved loot, provide a healthy experience
bonus, and respawn much more quickly when killed. Happy hunting!

  * Human Illusion: This affect is no longer applied to worgen who travel into
the Caverns of Time.

exalted.

beach gates has been destroyed, it will put the player behind the Red gate.

  * Tol Barad

    * Players will now be teleported out of the Tol Barad micro dungeons 15
minutes before the beginning of the next battle.

    * The weekly PvP quest "Victory in Tol Barad" now awards 200 Honor Points

    * Players can now see the status of Tol Barad on the World Map no matter

from 1.75. In addition, it is now possible to use and waste this ability when
not snared or rooted. This is consistent with other dispels.

  * Forbearance

    * The duration has been lowered to 1 minute, down from 2.

    * Lay on Hands now causes Forbearance on the target. It used to only cause
it when cast on the paladin. This was an old design from when Divine

from using their defensive cooldown.

most abilities which modify healing (such as Beacon of Light). In addition,
Lay on Hands is no longer on the global cooldown.

immune targets. With Rebuke baseline, this functionality is no longer
necessary.

impairing effects from vehicles the paladin is riding.

      * Divine Purpose: The chance for applicable abilities to generate Holy
Power has been reduced to 7/15%, down from 20/40%, but instead of generating 1
Holy Power, the next applicable ability used consumes no Holy Power and acts
as if the paladin has 3 Holy Power.

      * Divine Storm weapon damage percent increased from 80% to 100%.

      * Hand of Light (Mastery): A percentage of the damage done by Templar's
Verdict, Crusader Strike, and Divine Storm is done as additional Holy damage.
