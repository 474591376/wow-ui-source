**World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Beta Patch Notes (version 13117)**

Welcome to the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta test! Patch notes listed here
are not comprehensive and will be changed throughout the testing process.

To leave feedback about your test experience, please visit our [Cataclysm Beta
forums][1]. You may need to clear your browser cookies and cache and log out
of our [live forums][2] in order to view the beta forums.

**General**

  * The Alliance starting experience for worgen is available. Venture through
the cursed lands of Gilneas to discover your true path!

    * Running Wild is a new racial ability for worgen. In place of a mount,
this ability has a 1.5 second cast time and allows the worgen to run on all
fours at their fastest mounted ground speed.

  * The Horde starting experience for goblins is available. Beginning on the
Isle of Kezan in a goblin paradise, players will face a treacherous road
ahead!

  * The level cap for all characters is 85.

  * The Guild Advancement feature is now fully implemented. You can discuss
the elements of this feature and leave feedback for us on the [Guild
Advancement forum][3].

  * Creature damage output has been increased from roughly level 65 and up.
These increases scale upward with level. Creatures in exterior zones at level
80 now have 2.5 times the damage output they did previously in beta, 3.2 times
at level 81, and 4 times at level 82 and up. To leave feedback about how this
change feels with regard to creature spawns in level 80-85 exterior zones,
visit our forums [here][4].

  * Cataclysm Launcher Update

    * The new Cataclysm Launcher allows you to stream game data while you
play. This will reduce the time you spend downloading, installing, and
patching World of Warcraft. We'd like to get your feedback on the toolset and
gameplay experience. Please head to the forums [here][5] for additional
information.

  * Flight Master's License is a new flight skill required for flying around
Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, available to characters levels 60 and higher
for 250 gold.

  * Players may use our Character Copy feature for copying existing characters
to beta realms, or may choose from high-level pre-made template characters.

  * Level 85 pre-made template characters are now available for copy.

**PvP**

  * Honor has been adjusted completely. Any activity which yields Honor will
now award much less. The Honor cost of items has been reduced to compensate.

  * Tol Barad is now available for testing. Players can reach the zone by
speaking to NPCs in the capital cities.

  * Battlegrounds

    * Battleground queues should once again be functional.

    * [Twin Peaks][6] is now available for testing.

    * The Battle for Gilneas is now available for testing.

**Zones**

  * Mount Hyjal and Vashj'ir are available for testing.

  * Deepholm is available for testing.

  * Uldum is partially available for testing.

  * Twilight Highlands is partially available for testing.

  * The level ranges of Gilneas and the Lost Isles are in the process of being
adjusted slightly. Creature, quest, and quest reward levels are all being
altered so that players finish questing in these zones roughly by level 12.
Further fine tuning will continue in future content updates.

  * Several zones have had quest maps integrated.

  * Eastern Kingdoms

    * Arathi Highlands, Badlands, Blasted Lands, Burning Steppes, The Cape of
Stranglethorn, Dun Morogh, Duskwood, Eastern Plaguelands, Elwynn Forest,
Hillsbrad Foothills, Hinterlands, Loch Modan, Northern Stranglethorn,
Northshire, Redridge Mountains, Searing Gorge, Silverpine Forest, Swamp of
Sorrows, Tirisfal Glades, Western Plaguelands and Westfall are ready for
testing.

  * Kalimdor

    * Most zones in Kalimdor are available for testing, though work continues
on polishing the quest experience and flow, as well as zone aesthetics.

**Dungeons & Raids**

  * Flexible Raid Lock System

    * All Wrath of the Lich King raids now use the new Flexible Raid Lock
system. This system provides the opportunity for a character to defeat each
raid zone's encounters once a week. A character may now complete the
encounters during the week with different raids of either 10 or 25 players.

  * Trial of the Crusader now uses the Dynamic Difficulty system found in
Icecrown Citadel and The Ruby Sanctum.

  * Hero Points have been renamed Justice Points.

  * All 5-player Cataclysm dungeons are now available for testing.

  * Players no longer need to discover pre-Cataclysm dungeons in order to
access them via the Looking For Dungeon system. All Cataclysm level 80-85
dungeons still need to be discovered before being unlocked in the system.

**Classes: General**

  * All spell and ability tooltips will now display damage averages rather
than minimum and maximum damage potential. This feature is on by default but
can be changed via the Display settings under User Interface options. Note:
this change has not yet been implemented for the mage class.

  * Ammo has been removed from the game.

  * The character levels at which classes gain new spells and abilities have
changed.

  * Many item and class stats have been changed or removed.

  * Rage has been normalized.

  * Spells and abilities no longer have multiple ranks and now scale with
character level.

  * New talent trees have been implemented.

    * Each specialization has been reduced to a 31-point talent tree.

    * Players will now get a total of 41 talent points to spend.

    * 31 points must be spent in the primary specialization tree before any
points can be placed in additional trees.

    * Players will be asked to choose a specialization at level 10. Doing so
will result in the unlocking of a spell or ability unique to that
specialization, as well as one or more passive bonuses.

    * More information regarding our plans for talent trees can be found
[here][7].

**Death Knights**

  * A dedicated tanking tree has been implemented.

  * The way in which runes recharge has changed.

**Druids**

  * A new Eclipse mechanic has been added for druids. The feature is
functional, but the interface art is still a work in-progress.

**Hunters**

  * Five pets can now be stored with the hunter at all times. Any one of these
five pets can be summoned via the Call Pet ability.

  * Focus has replaced mana as a new resource.

  * Hunters now start with a pet at level 1.

  * The Stable will now store 20 pets. If a pet is moved into the Stable, its
talents are wiped.

**Mages**

  * There is now a new spell fly-out UI feature for mage portals. Clicking on
the Teleport or Portal buttons will expand the list of choices available.

**Paladins**

  * Paladins now have a new resource bar.

  * We are in the process of overhauling many paladin talents, spells and
abilities. Expect updates in upcoming patches.

**Warlocks**

  * There is now a new spell fly-out UI feature for warlock pets. Clicking on
this single button will open up the list of available pets to summon.

  * Soul Shards have been removed from the game as items. Instead, they now
exist as a resource system necessary for using, or altering the mechanics of
certain spells.

**Items**

  * Resilience no longer reduces the chance a player will be critically hit by
an opponent.

  * Durability: cloth, leather, and mail now have as many points of durability
as plate, making the repair cost on death much closer to equal for all
classes.

**Professions**

  * Archaeology, a new secondary profession, has been added. Players can learn
this profession in order to search for ancient artifacts around the world to
advance their Archaeology skill and create unique new items.

    * To recover artifacts, you need to collect artifact fragments. Fragments
are found in dig sites visible on your map. When you reach a dig site, use the
Survey ability. Your survey tool will indicate the approximate direction and
distance to the cache of fragments. You can collect fragments three times in a
dig site before you need to move to a new dig site. Once you have enough
fragments, you can solve an artifact to learn a little more about Azeroth's
past. Happy hunting!

      * Research sites that are too high a level (60-85 zones and continents)
will no longer show up if a player's Archaeology skill isn't yet high enough.

      * All kinds of artifacts will grant 5 points of skill. Previously,
lower-level artifacts wouldn't grant any skill.

      * Keystones now count as 12 fragments.

      * Players now gain experience when collecting fragments.

      * Many bugs have been fixed with keystones and dig sites.

  * The updated glyph system is now functional.

  * The Reforging interface has been implemented and the NPCs should now be
functional for testing this feature.

**User Interface**

browse through the new settings and leave feedback about any potential issues
or bugs.

  * The ability to use third-party addons has been enabled.

  * Leave feedback about the latest user interface changes [ here][8].

  * Spell Alerts have been added to notify players when procs on select spells
and abilities occur. A visual notification will display around the character
and the activated ability will be highlighted on the action bar.

  * The Arena Teams pane has been improved.

  * Auto-quests have been added to the game. Players will automatically be
given an auto-quest by entering specific areas in the game world. This alert
will appear distinctly in the Objectives pane via the Advanced Quest Tracking
feature. These quests will still be given to players with full Quest Logs, but
will count toward the 25 total allotted quests if the log is not full.

  * The Character pane has been redesigned. Character stats can now be shown
or hidden via the Show All Details/Hide All Details button on the bottom left.
When shown, all character stats will be visible in a window to the right of
the pane. Stat sections can be reorganized by clicking and dragging them up or
down the pane.

  * The Professions panes now have more filtering and search functionality, as
well as buttons to easily link recipes in the chat frame.

  * A Professions screen has been added to the Spellbook to better display the
details of a character's primary and secondary professions.

  * Many of the yellow System Messages that would display in the chat frame
when leveling up have been removed.

information on when new talents, spells and abilities are available.

display available and upcoming purchases.

party frames so that players can test them.

visual appeal.

the Graphics Panel)
