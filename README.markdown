### Chat Frame

* Players can now right-click on any chat type (Whisper, Trade, General, Party, Raid, etc.) and choose the Pop Out Chat option. This will move that chat type to a separate tab in the Chat frame which can be undocked and moved anywhere on the screen.
   * Using the Pop Out Chat option on a Whisper will place the conversation with that player in a separate tab.
   * Any time a conversation with another player is put into its own tab, the tab will glow when a new message is received.
* Hovering over the Chat Frame and using the mouse wheel will allow players to scroll through chat text.
* Players can select Classic Mode under Interface Options to keep the Chat Frame functionality closer to what it was prior to patch 3.3.5.
* The Simple Chat User Interface option has been removed.

### Friends List

* A new icon has been added to the top left of the Chat Frame which will open up the Friends list.
* In addition to its current functionality, the Friends List will now allow players to add Battle.net accounts (Real ID). Players will have to confirm that they are friends in order for a Real ID to be added. Once Real ID friends, players can communicate cross-game, cross-faction and cross-realm.
* A new Pending tab has been added where players can accept or decline a Real ID friend request, or select the Report Spam or Block Communications buttons.
* Players can now select from three statuses which will be visible to their friends: Available, Away and Busy.
* A Broadcast window has been added to the top of the frame. Players can use this to broadcast a message to all of their Real ID friends online. This message will also be displayed under the broadcaster’s Real ID information in each friend’s list.
